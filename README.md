KATA 1 - In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.<br>  
KATA 2 - An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.<br> 
KATA 3 - Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.<br>
KATA 4 - In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.<br>
