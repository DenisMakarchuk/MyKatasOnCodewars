<p align="justify">
<b>KATA 1 </b> - In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.<br>  
<b>KATA 2 </b> - An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.<br> 
<b>KATA 3 </b> - Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.<br>
<b>KATA 4 </b> - In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.<br>
<b>KATA 5 </b> - A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.
He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?
Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:<br>
Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0<br>
Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1<br>
Float parameter "window" must be less than h.<br>
If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
Note:
The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.<br>
<b>KATA 6 </b> - Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.<br>
  <b>KATA 7</b> - You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form.<br>
  <b>KATA 8</b> - Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.<br>
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.<br>
  <b>KATA 9</b> - Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.<br>
  <b>KATA 10</b> - In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.<br><br>
  <b>KATA 11</b> - ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.<br>
Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".<br>
  <b>KATA 12</b> - Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.
Note: a and b are not ordered!<br>
  <b>KATA 13</b> - There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.<br>
You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.<br>
Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D<br>
Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.<br>
The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.<br>
  <b>KATA 14</b> - Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.<br>
  <b>KATA 15</b> - Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.<br>
