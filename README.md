<p align="justify">
<b>KATA 1 </b> - In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.<br>  
<b>KATA 2 </b> - An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.<br> 
<b>KATA 3 </b> - Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.<br>
<b>KATA 4 </b> - In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.<br>
<b>KATA 5 </b> - A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.
He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?
Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:<br>
Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0<br>
Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1<br>
Float parameter "window" must be less than h.<br>
If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
Note:
The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.<br>
